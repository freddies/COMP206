If you understand the concept of absolute / relative paths, you can write common code that need not have separate logic for absolute path arguments vs relative path arguments - and they are quite straight forward and simple.


Ex 1.

use -ef to check if two arguments point to the same file (works across abs/relative paths, links, etc.)

Ex 2.

To pick only the lines with valid numbers from the in put file, you can just use the grep concepts shown in class

for num in $(grep '^[1-9][0-9]\{0,18\}$' < nums.txt | grep -v '^[0-1]$') # pick only the entries that are valid for our range.
do
....


--

For the largest prime, store the largest prime seen so far (initialize it to 0). Every time it reports a prime, check with the previously reported largest prime AND UPDATE it.

Once outside the loop, print the largest prime if it is > 0.
